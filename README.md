# Misc Python Programs

Various python programs for making my life easier.

## Anki Flashcard Generator

A proof of concept I was exploring. Generates Anki-compatible flashcards from a directory of markdown notes (for an AWS exam). I was exploring spec-driven development with Claude Code, so much of this can be thrown away.

## Cache Management Simulator

Small scripts I wrote in ECE 5362 - Computer Architecture at Ohio State. K-way set associative mapping is a method for managing cache in computer systems. The specifc assignment asked to manually calculate cache hits and misses for a 32-bit byte addressable computer using 2-way or 4-way set associative mapping. These scripts do it automatically and print the results.

## Digial Signal Processing (DSP) Notebook

Some examples of aliasing in digital signal processing.

## DuckDB Car Tracking

> Note that this was moved into its own dedicated repo: [duckdb-wasm-demo](https://github.com/alexshank/duckdb-wasm-demo)

Simple analysis of CSV car maintenance history using DuckDB.

## Fractals

Programmatically drawing fractals for fun. Maybe to make graphics for my personal website.

## LeetCode

Selected problems that I copied over from the LeetCode site during interview prep. I likely needed a proper IDE and debug statements for these problems.

## Softball Linear Optimization

> Note that this was moved into its own dedicated repo: [softball-optimization](https://github.com/alexshank/softball-optimization)

A program that uses linear optimization techniques to determine the optimal batting lineup for a softball team. It takes player statistics as input and calculates the lineup that maximizes the team's expected performance.
