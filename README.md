## cache management simulator
Small scripts I wrote in ECE 5362 - Computer Architecture at Ohio State. K-way set associative mapping is a method for managing cache in computer systems. The specifc assignment asked to manually calculate cache hits and misses for a 32-bit byte addressable computer using 2-way or 4-way set associative mapping. These scripts do it automatically and print the results.
