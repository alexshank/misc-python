## 08-17-2025 - Learn Cantrill 

- trying to watch a demo of the three different federation setups
	- beginning to use https://learn.cantrill.io/ as a supplemental training material
	- has useful demos and scenarios
- detouring through Learn Cantrill's conent...
	- course intro content
	- AWS account setup demos
	- OSI Networking Layers overview
- OSI 7-Layer Networking Model
	- a CONCEPTUAL model, not always how networks are implemented
		- e.g., finding clear division between layer 4/5 not valuable
	- note that a "layer X" device has all lower layers as well
	- this means that an L3 router understands layers 1, 2, and 3
	- layer 1, physical, dumb, many collisions, copper/fiber/wifi
		- HUBS are dumb repeater devices on this layer
	- layer 2, data link, introduces frames, physical devices have pre-defined MAC addresses
		- uses carrier signal to know when coast is clear to send frame
		- random, increasing backoff
		- SWITCHES use MAC Address tables to avoid dumb repeating
		- each port is a separate collision domain!!!
	- layer 3, network, getting from one network to another (not LAN)
		- introduces the IP protocol (IPv4 vs IPv6)
		- the LAN networks do NOT have to have same L2 protocol
		- the IP packet is continuously encapsulated by different L2 frames at each network (hop)
		- the IP packet contains a field specifying the L4 protocol
		- IPv4
			- first two octets define the network, second two define the host (in the /16 prefix case)
			- subnet mask determines if packet needs to go to gateway (typically your router)
			- route tables and routes with most specificity are utilized
			- packets then repackaged for L2 transport via MAC Address translation (Address Resolution Protocol)
		- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
			- L2 broadcast to ask for MAC address of matching IP address
		- layer 4 will address the issues of...
			- no channels of communication (different conversations between same two IPs)
			- no ordering of packets
			- no delivery guaruntee
			- no flow control
		- Network Address Translation (NAT) used for multiple private IPs to share single public IP
	- layer 4/5, transport/session
		- TCP or UDP are typical layer 4 protocols
		- TCP
			- has segments that are each encapsulatted into an IP packet
			- introduces ports for multiple conversations
			- introduces sequence number and acknowledgement
			- introduces window for managing send/recieve volumes
			- connect via random (ephemeral) client port and known server port
				- NACLs (stateless) in AWS often have to whitelist these "high ports"
				- SGs (stateful) in AWS will allow inverse traffic back out
			- three-way handshake
				- common flags can be set (SYN, SYN-ACK FIN, ACK)
				- basically using two unique sequence numbers and ACKs
		- strictly speaking, managing state in the firewall would be a layer 5 technology
			- HTTP cookies would also be a layer 5 technology
	- layer 6, presentation, how to interpret or translate data to a standard format for other applications
		- HTTP using ASCII encoding is an example
		- often combined with / achieved by application layer
	- layer 7, application, what commands the interpreted data correspond to
		- for HTTP, "G-E-T" means GET and the command fetches data
- there are other networking models like the 5 layer TCP/IP model
- FTP could have a completely different layer 5, 6, 7 implementation
	- it could entirely ignore a L5 implementation
- don't worry too much about making everything fit perfectly into the conceptual frameworks
