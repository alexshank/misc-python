## Step Functions

- don't need to know in depth, just the capabilities and where it fits in your architecture
- flow represented by JSON sate machine
- features
    - sequence
    - parrallel
    - conditions
    - timeouts
    - error handling
- maximum execution time of one year!!!
- human approval feature
- note the extra latency between step function and lambda communication
- optimized integrations
    - Lambda
    - AWS Batch
    - DynamoDB
    - EMR
    - other Step Functions
    - many others
- AWS SDK Integrations
    - pretty standard, 200+ AWS services available
- many example workflows available in the AWS docs
    - e.g., coordinate all the steps of training a ML model with SageMaker, S3, etc.
- Step Functions Tasks
    - Lambda Tasks
    - Activitiy Tasks (must use polling, is not serverless)
    - Service Tasks (connect to supported AWS service)
    - Wait Tasks (set duration or until timestamp)
- Step Functions do NOT integrate natively with AWS Mechanical Turk!!!
    - SWF is preferred over Step Functions for this???
- Standard Workflows vs Express Workflows
    - Express can kickoff many more executions per second
    - Express has shorter maximum duration
    - Express is at-least-once execution (instead of exactly-once)
    - Express priced similar to Lambdas (instead of per state transition)
- Express Workflow Synchronous vs Asynchronous
- can use error handling, retries, and alerting with State Machines
    - integrates with EventBridge, SNS, etc. for notifying about failures
- remember, steps like reading a DDB table can be done natively without a Lambda function
