## SNS Message Delivery Retries

- when SNS tries to send a message, and the destination has a server error
- delivery protocols and total attempts are key metrics
- backoff phases
    - immediate retry phase
    - pre-backoff phase
    - backoff phase
    - post-backoff phase
- AWS managed endpoints 
    - try 100,015 times over 23 days
- customer managed endpoints
    - SMTP protocol
    - try 50 times in 6 hours
- HTTP/S endpoints support custom retry policies
    - e.g., your backend does not like heavy load from retries
    - backoffFunction
    - sicklyRetryPolicy
- SNS Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)
    - after delivery policy is exhausted, discard message unless DLQ is configured
    - DLQ is configured on a per subscription basis, NOT a per topic basis
    - must use SQS FIFO for SNS FIFO???
