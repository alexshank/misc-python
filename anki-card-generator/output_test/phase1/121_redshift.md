## Redshift

- analytics data warehousing
- based on Postgres, but not for Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)
- Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)
- Massively Parallel Query execution (MPP)
- integrates with tools like AWS Quicksight and Tableau
- Database Migration Service (DMS) and other data loading options
- only certain clusters have multi-AZ options
- leader vs compute node
- Redshift Enhanced VPC Routing for reduced costs???
- Athena is better if queries are sporadic and you don't want to provision resources
- snapshots are incremental
- CANNOT restore snapshots into an old cluster
- snapshots work similarly to RDS
- can automate copy of snapshots to different regions
- "Redshift snapshot copy grant" for different KMS keys in different regions
- Redshift Spectrum - query S3 data that is not loaded into Redshift
  - must have Redshift cluster available to start the query
  - does Redshift Spectrum manage all of its own nodes???
- Redshift Workload Management (WLM) - queues for managing query priorities
  - automatic WLM vs manual WLM
- Concurrency Scaling Cluster for increased requests
  - WLM can control which queries go to this cluster
