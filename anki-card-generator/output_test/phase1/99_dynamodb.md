## DynamoDB

- NoSQL and fully managed
- Similar to Apache Cassandra
- max object size is 400KB
- provisioned vs on-demand capacity
- eventual or strong consistency for READS
- transactions across multiple tables (ACID)
- PITR for backups
- standard and Infrequent Access (IA) tables classes
- primary key and attributes
- data types include
	- scalar
	- document
	- set
- sort key == range key
- object = parition key + optional sort key + attributes
- Local Secondary Index (LSI)
	- alternative sort key
	- must be defined at table creation time
- Global Secondary Index (GSI)
	- change the primary key and optional sort key
	- can be defined after table creation time
- TTL on rows
- DynamoDB Streams can be read by many services
	- 24 hour retention of data
- Global Tables
	- active-active replicaiton, many regions
	- requires having DynamoDB Streams enabled
	- good for low latency and disaster recovery
- send DynamoDB Streams to Kinesis Data Streams
	- if you want longer retention
	- you want to use other tools like Kinesis Data Firehouse
	- or Kinesis Data Analytics
	- etc.
- common pattern is to index S3 objects using DynamoDB and S3 Events
- DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)
	- cache for DynamoDB
	- 5 minute TTL by default
	- up to 10 nodes in cluster
	- Multi AZ (at least 3 nodes recommended for production)
	- has encryption at rest
- DAX vs ElastiCache
	- if you're directly accessing DynamoDB, use DAX
	- if you do any computation with the DynamoDB results, use ElastiCache
