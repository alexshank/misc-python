## Cloud Migration Strategies - The 7 R's

- blog post on AWS about the 7 R's
- concepts and diagram are important to read and understand!!!
- Retire (turn things off)
- Retain (no migration)
- Relocate (move from on-prem to cloud, or EC2 to a new account)
- Rehost (lift and shift, no change to application setups)
  - example: using AWS Application Migration Service
- Replatform (lift and reshape, get some Cloud optimizations)
  - example: RDS doesn't change application, but gives you automated backups
- Repurchase (drop and shop, quick to move to SaaS)
  - example: CRM to Salesforce
- Refactor / Re-architect (re-design application, most effort, most payoff)
  - example: move to a serverless architecture, use S3
