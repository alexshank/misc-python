## AWS Outposts

- Hybrid Cloud = businesses keep on-premise infra alongside cloud infra
- an "Outposts Racks" is installed on-premise with pre-loaded AWS services
- same APIs as usual, but you are responsible for physical security of hardware
- AWS DataSync could be used to sync S3 on Outposts bucket to standard Amazon S3 bucket
