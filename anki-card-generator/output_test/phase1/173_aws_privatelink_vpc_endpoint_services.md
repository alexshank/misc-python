## AWS PrivateLink (VPC Endpoint Services)

- most secure and scalable way to expose a service to 1000's of VPCs
  - no VPC peering, internet gateway, NAT, route tables, etc.
- NLBs for the service application and ENIs for the consumer application
- understand the PrivateLink for S3 with Direct Connect diagram???
- Direct Connect Public VIF vs Private VIF???
- last slide architecture doesn't require PrivateLink, just VPC Peering???
