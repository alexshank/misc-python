## Amazon DocumentDB

- the MongoDB (NoSQL) version of AWS Aurora
- pay for what you use, no upfront cost
- you pay for...
  - on-demand instances per second
  - database I/O per million I/Os
  - database storage per GB/month
  - backup storage per GB/month
- DocumentDB is all provisioned???
  - there is no on-demand tier, but uses on-demand instances???
  - this is very similar to Aurora???
