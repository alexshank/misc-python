## Direct Connect

- provides dedicated PRIVATE connection from remote network to your VPC
- more expensive than VPN
- must use Direct Connect locations
- private access to AWS via Private VIF
- bypasses your ISP, reduces network costs, increases bandwidth and stability
- NOT redundant (would need a second DX created)
- VIF = Virtual Interface
  - Public VIF for anything AWS (e.g., EC2 service)
  - Private VIF connect to resources in VPC (e.g., EC2 instance)
- Transit Virtual Interface connects to resource in VPC via Transit Gateway
- VPC Interface Endpoints can be accessed through Private VIF
- should understand the Direct Connect Diagram slide architecture
- Dedicated Connections or Hosted Connections
  - can add or remove capacity for Hosted Connections
  - > 1 month lead time for new connections
- NOT encrypted by default (use VPN over DX Public VIF)
  - architecture diagram shows Private VIF though???
- Link Aggregation Groups (LAG) logically groups DX connections
  - active-active for increased speed and failover
  - requires Dedicated Connections
  - requires identical bandwidths
  - must terminate at same AWS Connect Endpoint
- Direct Connect Gateway to connect to VPC across regions and / or across accounts
  - allows you to integrates the DX with Transit Gateway
