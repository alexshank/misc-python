  - scaling strategies
    - Target Tracking
    - Step Scaling
    - Scheduled Scaling
- CPU and RAM tracked in CloudWatch at ECS Service level
  - Note the previous comment that "RAM IS NOT INCLUDED IN AWS EC2 METRICS"
- Fargate Auto Scaling is easier, because you don't need your ECS Service Auto Scaling to be in lockstep with your EC2 Auto Scaling
- FARGATE_SPOT for cost-savings
- ECR public and private repositories
  - IAM policies needed to give EC2 instance role access to images
