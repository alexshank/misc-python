## Storage Gateway

- hybrid cloud is useful or required for various reasons
- AWS Storage Gateway gives on-premise infra access to cloud native storage
  - example: block, file, and object storage
- bidirectional (access your on-premise data as well)
- types of Storage Gateways
  - S3 File Gateway
  - FSx File Gateway
  - Volume Gateway
  - Tape Gateway
- S3 File Gateway
  - no glacier tiering
  - interact with S3 like a normal file share
  - NFS and SMB protocols
  - caching for most recently used file in the gateway
  - SMB protocol is more for Windows, so has Active Directory (AD) integration
- FSx File Gateway
  - already accessible for your on-premise machines
  - only benefit is the local cache in the gateway in your data center
  - Windows native compatibility
  - useful for group file shares and home directories
- Volume Gateway
  - block storage using iSCSI protocol backed by S3???
  - can help restore on-premise volumes???
  - Cached and Stored volumes
  - need to understand better!!!
- Tape Gateway
  - Virtual Tape Library (VTL) backed by S3
  - iSCSI protocol
  - the company is responsible for using the physical tapes / media changers
  - works with leading backup vendors
- company would typical run these gateways on one of its servers
  - alternative is the Storage Gateway Hardware Appliance
  - has all the needed resources to function correctly as any of the gateway types
- good architecture diagram to conclude section
