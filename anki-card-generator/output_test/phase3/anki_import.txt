What is the primary function of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)?	AWS IAM allows you to manage users, groups, and roles, and define permissions for how they can interact with AWS resources.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
How does AWS IAM help control access to AWS resources?	IAM allows you to securely manage identities and permissions for users and AWS services, granting specific access levels to AWS resources.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
What kind of resources can you control access to using AWS IAM?	IAM controls access to various AWS resources, allowing you to define who can access what in your AWS environment.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
What is the principle of least privilege in the context of AWS IAM?	The principle of least privilege means granting only the minimum permissions necessary for a user or service to perform its required tasks, thereby minimizing potential security risks.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
Why is it important to follow the principle of least privilege when configuring AWS IAM?	Following the principle of least privilege reduces the attack surface and potential damage if an identity is compromised, as it limits what an attacker could do.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
What does it mean to create a 'user' in AWS IAM?	An IAM user represents a person or application that needs to interact with AWS, and it is associated with a specific AWS account.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
What are 'groups' in AWS IAM and how are they used?	IAM groups are collections of IAM users. You can attach policies to a group, and all users in that group inherit those permissions, simplifying management.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
How do IAM groups simplify permission management for multiple users?	By assigning permissions to a group instead of individual users, any user added to that group automatically receives those permissions, centralizing and simplifying permission management.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
What is an IAM 'role' and how does it differ from a user or group?	An IAM role is an identity that you can assume to grant temporary permissions to trusted entities (users, services, or applications) without creating long-term credentials.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
When would you use an IAM role instead of an IAM user or group?	IAM roles are used for temporary permissions, such as granting an EC2 instance access to an S3 bucket, or allowing a user from another AWS account to access resources in your account.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
What is an IAM 'policy'?	An IAM policy is a document that formally defines permissions, specifying who can access what AWS resources and under what conditions.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
What is the format of an IAM policy document?	IAM policy documents are written in JSON.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
What are the two main types of IAM policies?	The two main types of IAM policies are Identity-based policies and Resource-based policies.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
Explain what an Identity-based policy in AWS IAM is.	Identity-based policies are attached to an IAM identity (user, group, or role) and explicitly grant permissions for that identity to access specific AWS resources.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
Where are Identity-based policies attached in AWS IAM?	Identity-based policies are attached to IAM users, groups, or roles.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
What is a Resource-based policy in AWS IAM?	Resource-based policies are attached directly to an AWS resource (like an S3 bucket or SQS queue) and specify who can access that resource and what actions they can perform on it.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
Can Resource-based policies grant permissions to entities from other AWS accounts?	Yes, Resource-based policies can grant permissions to entities (users, roles) from other AWS accounts.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
What are the three categories of Identity-based policies in AWS IAM?	Identity-based policies can be categorized as AWS Managed Policies, Customer Managed Policies, and Inline Policies.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
What is an AWS Managed Policy in IAM?	AWS Managed Policies are pre-defined policies created and managed by AWS that cover common use cases, like 'AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess'. You cannot edit them.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
Can you modify an AWS Managed Policy in IAM?	No, AWS Managed Policies are immutable; you cannot edit them.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
What is a Customer Managed Policy in IAM?	Customer Managed Policies are custom policies that you create, own, and manage within your AWS account to precisely control permissions according to your specific needs.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
When would you create a Customer Managed Policy in IAM?	You would create a Customer Managed Policy when AWS Managed Policies don't provide the exact set of permissions you require for your users, groups, or roles.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
What is an Inline Policy in IAM?	Inline policies are policies embedded directly within a single IAM user, group, or role. They are explicitly tied to the lifecycle of that specific identity.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
What is a characteristic of Inline Policies regarding their lifecycle?	Inline policies are deleted automatically when the IAM identity (user, group, or role) to which they are attached is deleted.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
What are the key elements of an IAM policy document structure?	An IAM policy document includes 'Version', 'Id' (optional), and 'Statement'. The 'Statement' itself contains 'Sid' (optional), 'Effect', 'Principal' (Resource-based policies only), 'Action', 'Resource', and 'Condition' (optional).	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
What does the 'Effect' element specify in an IAM policy statement?	The 'Effect' element specifies whether the statement 'Allow's or 'Deny's access to the specified actions and resources.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
What does the 'Action' element specify in an IAM policy statement?	The 'Action' element specifies the particular AWS API operations or actions that the policy allows or denies (e.g., 's3:GetObject', 'ec2:RunInstances').	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
What does the 'Resource' element specify in an IAM policy statement?	The 'Resource' element specifies the AWS resources to which the policy applies, identified by their Amazon Resource Name (ARN) (e.g., 'arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*').	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
What does the 'Condition' element allow you to do in an IAM policy statement?	The 'Condition' element allows you to specify additional criteria that must be met for the policy to take effect, such as time of day, source IP address, or whether MFA was used.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
How is multi-factor authentication (MFA) implemented in AWS?	MFA for AWS involves adding an extra layer of security where users provide a second form of authentication (like a code from a virtual or hardware device) in addition to their username and password.	aws_service:IAM section:IAM
What types of MFA devices are supported by AWS?	AWS supports virtual MFA devices (like authenticator apps on smartphones) and hardware MFA devices (such as YubiKey or Gemalto tokens).	aws_service:IAM section:IAM

What is a best practice regarding the use of the root account in AWS Organizations?	It's best practice to use the root account only for tasks that specifically require it and to keep its credentials highly secured, using it minimally for day-to-day operations.	aws_service:AWS_Organizations section:IAM
What are Organizational Units (OUs) in AWS Organizations?	Organizational Units (OUs) are logical groupings of AWS accounts within an AWS organization, allowing for hierarchical structuring and easier management of policies across accounts.	aws_service:AWS_Organizations section:IAM
How do OUs help manage policies in AWS Organizations?	OUs allow you to group accounts and attach policies to the OU, which then apply to all accounts within that OU and any nested OUs, enabling granular control.	aws_service:AWS_Organizations section:IAM
What are Service Control Policies (SCPs) in AWS Organizations?	Service Control Policies (SCPs) are policies that allow you to centrally manage permissions for all accounts in your organization, defining the maximum available permissions for IAM users and roles in those accounts.	aws_service:AWS_Organizations section:IAM
How do SCPs enforce permissions across multiple AWS accounts?	SCPs define permission guardrails, meaning they specify the maximum permissions available to any IAM user or role in the affected accounts. They don't grant permissions but filter what can be granted.	aws_service:AWS_Organizations section:IAM
Can SCPs grant permissions?	No, SCPs do not grant permissions. They only act as a filter or guardrail, defining the maximum permissions that IAM users and roles within an account can have.	aws_service:AWS_Organizations section:IAM
