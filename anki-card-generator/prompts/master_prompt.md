1. Open @implementation_status.md and identify any prompts not marked as completed.
2. For each incomplete prompt:
   - Double-check if it's truly unfinished (if uncertain, ask for clarification)
   - If you confirm it's already done, skip it.
   - Otherwise, implement it as described.
   - Make sure the tests pass, and the program builds/runs
   - Commit the changes to your repository with a clear commit message.
   - Update @implementation_status.md:
     - Mark the checkbox as complete: change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
     - Update the "Completed" count (e.g., from `**Completed**: 0/14` to `**Completed**: 1/14`)
3. After you finish each prompt, pause and wait for user review or feedback.
4. Repeat with the next unfinished prompt as directed by the user.
