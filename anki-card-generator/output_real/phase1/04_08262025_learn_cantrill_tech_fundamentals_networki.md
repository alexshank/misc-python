- DNS
	- ".com" is an example of a Top Level Domain (TLD)
	- if a Name Server and its Hosted Zone(s) are pointed to by an Authoritative server, they are Authoritative
		- THIS ONLY FOLLOWS FOR AN AUTHORATIVE TLD NAME SERVER!!!
	- DNS resolver in your router or ISP handles most work on your behalf
	- a DNS query can resolve to another DNS name (poor performance)
	- Domain Registrars are NOT the same as DNS Hosting Provider
		- many companies server as both though
		- e.g., Route 53
- DNSSEC - secure version of DNS
	- two main benefits over standard DNS
		- (1) Data Origin Authentication
		- (2) Data Integrity Protection
	- DNS cache poisoning is one issue DNSSEC solves
	- DNSSEC adds additional response data to DNS (does not replace DNS)
	- Chain of Trust used to verify DNS resolving
	- asymm encryption used to verify RRSIG signature values
	- Resource Record Sets (RRSETs) are verified not, individual resource records
	- Zone Signing Key (ZSK) and Key Signing Key (KSK) are critical
	- Zone Signing Key is encapsulated in single zone
		- it can be rotated freely without impacting parent zone
	- DS Records are used for validation in the Chain of Trust
	- the Signing Ceremony is how the Trust Anchor is established
	- HSMs are used to never expose the keys
	- the public "." DNS Root KSK verifies the Absolute Trust
	- many people are involved for redundancy and security
	- ceremony is repeated every three months (roughly)
- Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
	- decides how things are routed from point A to point B
	- made up of Autonomous Systems (AS)
		- routers controlled by one entity, aka a network
		- they are treated as black boxes by BGP
	- ASNs are uniquely allocated by IANA
		- can use reserved, private ASNs for private peering
	- BGP operates over tcp/179
		- peering needs to be manually configured though
	- ASPATH is the best path to the destination according to the peers
		- doesn't care about condition or link speed of the topology
	- iBGP and eBGP for internal / external communication
		- mostly work with eBGP in AWS
	- artificially lengthen path to tune traffic
		- e.g., avoid using sattelite AS every time
- Layer 7 Firewalls
	- layer 3 or 4 firewalls cannot see additional info like the HTTP method being used
	- you can decrpyt HTTPS, check contents, re-encrypt
	- you could even modify content at the firewall
	- doesn't have to be the HTTP protocol, could be others like SMTP
- IPSEC VPN Fundamentals
	- a set of protocols to setup secure tunnels across insecure networks
	- provides authentication and encryption
	- between two peers (local and remote)
	- called IPSEC Tunnels (for "interesting" traffic)
	- two main phases
		- IKE Phase 1 (slow and heavy)
			- creates phase 1 tunnel (IKE SA, "security association")
			- can be reused for multiple phase 2's, between interesting traffic
			- Diffy Helman key and exchange material are used to create symmetric key
		- IKE Phase 2 (fast and agile)
			- bulk symmetric encryption of "interesting" traffic
	- two types of VPNs
		- policy-based VPNs
			- Rule Sets match traffic and direct to a pair of Security Associations 
			- more difficult to setup, but give you different security fo different types of traffic
		- route-based VPNs
			- target matching the given IP prefix
- AWS Organizations
	- member accounts' billing info is disregarded for Consolidating Billing
	- Organization Root is container for all accounts in the org
	- some orgs have dedicated identity accounts
		- identity federation can be used to access these identities with on-premise IdP
		- use "role switch" to gain access to other accounts in the organization
