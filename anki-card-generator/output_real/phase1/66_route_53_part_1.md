## Route 53 - Part 1

- Hosted Zone = management system for DNS records of a domain and its subdomains
- record types
  - A, AAAA, CNAME, and NS are only relevant ones
  - can't create CNAME record for the top node of a DNS namespace (example.com)
- AWS resources expose an AWS hostname
- ALIAS records work for both ROOT and NON ROOT DOMAINS
  - free of charge
  - native health checks
  - targets include ELB, CloudFront Distribution, and others???
  - you CANNOT set an ALIAS record for an EC2 DNS name???
- TTL cost / outdated record tradeoff
- TTL required for all DNS records other than ALIAS
- Routing Policies
  - simple (no health checks)
  - weighted (health checks)
  - latency-based (health checks)
  - failover (Active-Passive) (health check mandatory)
  - geolocation (health checks)
    - based on user location (e.g., United States), not traffic to AWS regions
  - geoproximity (does this have health checks???)
    - based on user location (e.g., latitude / longitude), not traffic to AWS regions
    - must have Route 53 Traffic Flow enabled
    - uses Bias to manipulate weighting
    - Traffic Flow for maintaining large and complex record configurations
      - configurations can be saved as Traffic Flow Policy
      - Traffic Flow Policy supports versioning
  - multi-value (health checks)
    - limit 8 healthy records returned per query
    - is NOT a subsititute for an ELB
  - IP-based (does this have health checks???)
    - provide list of CIDRs for your clients
