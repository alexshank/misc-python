## Amazon Kinesis Data Firehouse

- store data into target destinations
- batch writes for efficiency
  - "near real-time"
- need to remember specifically
  - Redshift
  - S3
  - OpenSearch
  - Splunk
- automatic scaling (unlike Kinesis Data Streams)
- Lambda can be used for arbitrary transformations
- ORC data conversion is only for S3
  - possibly parquet as well???
- compression support to S3 and Redshift (GZIP)
- Spark and Kinesis Client Library (KCL) do NOT read from Kinesis Data Firehose (KDF)
  - only from Kinesis Data Streams (KDS)
- "blueprint" transformation lambdas
- S3 + copy command used to go to Amazon Redshift
- source records and transformation failures, and delivery failures can be written to an S3 bucket
  - no data loss is the key
- 1 minute minimum for buffer timeout
- KDF vs KDS
  - enhanced fan-out for stream latency???
