## Aurora - Part 2

- Aurora Serverless
	- as usual, good for infrequent, intermittent or unpredictable workloads
	- pay per second, can be more cost-effective
	- Data API for HTTPS endpoints to run SQL statements
		- leverages Secrets Manager for database credentials
		- need access to both the Data API and the underlying secret
	- are the following points still only related to Aurora Serverless???
	- RDS Proxy can be used in front of Aurora primary instance for R+W
	- RDS Proxy can be used in front of Read Replica instances for reading
	- Aurora Global Aurora
		- Cross-Region Read Replicas
		- Aurora Global Database (recommended)
			- 1 primary region for r+w
			- up to 5 read-only replication regions (less than 1 second replication lag)
			- up to 16 read replicas within each secondary region
			- RTO less than 1 minute for disaster recovery to secondary region
			- can manage RPO of Aurora for PostgreSQL
			- Write Forwarding lets secondary regions forward SQL commands to the primary
				- mostly helps with having to manage a bunch of different endpoints
		- convert RDS to Aurora via snapshot and restore
		- convert RDS to Aurora via Aurora Read Replica on an RDS DB instance 
			- promote to Aurora when replication lag is very low
