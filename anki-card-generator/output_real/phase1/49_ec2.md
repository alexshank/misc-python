## EC2

- instance types
- nice website for choosing AWS resource instance types
  - https://instances.vantage.sh/
  - EC2, RDS, ElastiCache, OpenSearch, etc.
- Placement Group strategies
  - stop, use CLI, start again to move
- EC2 Graviton for best performance (no Windows instances)
- RAM IS NOT INCLUDED IN AWS EC2 METRICS
  - need to push custom CloudWatch Metrics
- Disk metrics are for Instance Stores only
- recovery options for Instance vs System status checks???
