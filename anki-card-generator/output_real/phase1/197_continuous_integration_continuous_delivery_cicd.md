## Continuous Integration Continuous Delivery (CICD)

- Continuous Integration (CI)
	- deliver code faster with less bugs
	- build server worries about checks
- Continuous Delivery (CD)
	- ensure software can be deployed reliably
	- usually CodeDeploy, Jenkins CD, Spinnaker, etc.
	- builder servers and deployment servers
- tech stack stages for CICD (in order)
	- Code (AWS CodeCommit vs GitHub) (no other AWS alternative)
	- Build (AWS CodeBuild vs Jenkins CI) (no other AWS alternative)
	- Test (AWS CodeBuild vs Jenkins CI) (no other AWS alternative)
	- Deploy (AWS CodeDeploy or AWS Elastic Beanstalk)
	- Provision (AWS Elastic Beanstalk or User Managed EC2 Instances Fleet / CloudFormation)
- this can all be orchestrated using AWS CodePipeline
- good CICD architecture diagram (this is typical exam question!!!)
	- pretty standard dev practices
- can trigger AWS Lambda on every AWS CodeCommit commit
	- scan for leaked secrets, lock repo, send SNS, etc.
- manual approval stage is possible
- CodeBuild and ECR for Docker images
- CodePipeline for automated flows
- webhooks can be used to trigger CodePipeline from GitHub
	- GitHub App "CodeStar Source Connection" is more modern approach
- AWS CodeStar - "a cloud service designed to make it easier to develop, build, and deploy applications on AWS by simplifying the setup of your entire development project"
	- including project management dashboards, etc.
