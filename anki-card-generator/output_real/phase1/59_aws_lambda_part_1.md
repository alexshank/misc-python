## AWS Lambda - Part 1

- a lot of integrations
- a lot of languages
  - Customer Runtime API (Rust, Golang, etc.)
- lambda supports custom images, but for exam prefer ECS / Fargate
- limits
  - up to 10 GB RAM
  - CPU linked to RAM, not configurable
  - 15 minute timeout
  - /tmp storage limit 10 GB
  - etc. (look at slides)
- sync vs async payload limits???
- AWS Service Quotas service for requesting more concurrency
- Reserved Concurrency to avoid throttling
- CodeDeploy for automated traffic shifts
  - Linear
  - Canary
  - AllAtOnce
- Pre and Post Traffic hooks
- monitoring
  - need to ensure Lambda has execution role with an IAM policy that authorizes CloudWatch Logs
  - AWS X-Ray also available (configure, then use AWS SDK in code)
  - again, needs correct IAM policies
