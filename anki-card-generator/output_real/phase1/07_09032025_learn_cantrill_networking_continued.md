- all subnets have an associated Network Access Control List (NACL) 
	- it's a stateless firewall
	- lowest rule processed first!!!
	- implicit DENY if no rule matches
	- default rules of NACLs allow ALL traffic (NACL is ignored)
	- NACLs can use EXPLICIT denies, which is useful against bad actors
- Security Groups
	- stateful firewall
	- only IMPLICIT denies
	- higher up the networking stack, so can support logical resources
		- this includes itself and other AWS resources
	- security groups are NOT directly attached to subnets or instances
		- they are attached to Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)!!!
	- logical referencing scales very well
- AWS Local Zones
	- mostly for low latency benefits
	- can treat them like any other Availability Zone (AZ)
	- not all products support them
	- they still rely on parent region for some things (e.g., EBS Snapshots)
	- DX to local zones IS supported
- Border Gateway Protocl (BGP)
	- must manually configure any peering
	- eBGP is for routing between Autonomous Systems (AS)
	- eBGP is primarily what AWS architects would care about
	- prefix paths to avoid issues of slow connections (e.g., satellite)
- Global Accelerator
	- need to distinguish between CloudFront and Global Accelerator use cases
	- anycast IP addresses are the key technology
	- "get into the optimized AWS network faster"
	- Global Accelerator works for TCP or UDP!!!
	- it's a network product, it does NOT cache things
	- CloudFront is for HTTP/S only!!!
- AWS Site-to-Site VPN
	- a logical IPSec connection between a VPC and on-premise network over the public internet
		- could also be over Direct Connect (DX)
	- Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) is associated with a single VPC
	- Customer Gateway (CGW) is either..
		- the logical configuration within AWS
		- the physical router located on-premise
	- the VPN connection is between the VGW and the CGW
	- "partial high availability" if you only have a single on-premise router
		- resolve by adding more VGW endpoints and another router
	- Static vs Dynamic VPN
		- Dynamic VPN requires routers to support BGP
		- enable "route propogation" on the VPC to detect routes from the VGW whenever a VPN is active
	- exam considerations
		- VPN has a 1.25Gbps limit (not including your on-premise router and encryption overheads)
		- latency over public internet
		- charger per hour and per GB out
		- on-premise internet plan may have limits
		- speed of setup (takes a couple hours to configure)
		- use as backup for Direct Connect or with Direct Connect
- Transit Gateway (TGW) 
	- single network object to connect many VPCs to many on-premise networks
	- highly available and scalable (like other network gateways)
	- can connect to...
		- VPC
		- Site-to-Site VPN
		- Direct Connect Gateway
	- can peer Transit Gateways across regions and across accounts
	- supports transitive routing, so you do not need a mesh architecture
	- can share your TGW via AWS RAM
