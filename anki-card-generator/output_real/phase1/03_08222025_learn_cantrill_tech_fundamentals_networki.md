- Network Address Translation (NAT)
	- deals with IPv4 shortages
	- governing agencies give out public IPs to ISPs and then individuals
	- Static NAT is 1:1 private IP to public IP
		- AWS IGW is an example
	- Dynamic NAT is for when you have more private IPs than public IPs
	- Port Address Translation (PAT) aka "overloading"
		- map many private IPs to a single public IP
		- AWS NATGW is an example
	- IPv6 means you DO NOT need any form of address translation
	- public and private addresses CANNOT communicate over public internet
	- For PAT, the NAT device keeps track of / generates random public source ports
		- the private source ports of the private IP devices can conflict without issue
		- you CANNOT initiate a connection with a private device behind PAT
- IPv4 Addressing and Subnetting
	- you must be allocated a public IPv4 address
	- Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
	- 4.29 billion IP addresses
	- address spaces
		- Class A (first octet, huge businesses in early days)
		- Class B (first two octets, fewer IPs for each network)
		- Class C (first three octets, for small businesses)
		- Class D and E also exist, but are their own topic
	- private IPs are carved out of the Class A, B, C address spaces
	- 172.31 private network is used for default AWS VPC
	- should still always aim to avoid private network IP address overlaps
	- subnetting = splitting an original network into multiple address spaces
	- use a suffix like /16 to specify the starting bits of a subnetwork
		- larger the prefix value, smaller the network
		- one /16 network == two /17 networks
		- /0 is the entire internet
		- /32 is a single IP address
	- typically have an even number of subnets, but could just split one of the halves again to get 3
- SSL and TLS
	- privacy and data integrity between client and server
	- TLS is newer version of SSL
	- combination of asymmetric and symmetric encryption
	- identity verification (typically only verify the server, but could do both)
	- reliable connection (detect alternations)
	- TLS begins with an established TCP connection
	- three main phases for initiation
		- cipher suites (server returns certificate with public key)
		- authentication (client checks server's certificate via a known CA)
			- operating system and browser vendors have list of trusted Certificate Authorities (CA)
			- server makes a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
			- CA then generates a signed certificate for the server to use
		- key exchange (get from asymm to symm encryption for efficiency)
			- client creates pre-master key
			- pre-master key is shared via public key encrypt and private key decrypt
			- server and client each generate the same master secret
	- the application layer (e.g., HTTPS or FTPS) decides if TLS should be intiated
		- TLS is technically considered layer 6 presentation layer
		- TLS is practically considered layer 4 transport layer
 - Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
	- Recovery Point Objective
		- maximum amount of data (time) that can be lost (stomached) by the organization
		- i.e., time between successful backups
		- may be different between systems (e.g., can't lose bank transactions, but could lose internal tool's data)
	- Recovery Time Objective
		- maximum tolerable length of time a system can be down
		- starts the second the error happens, ends when you hand the system back to the business folks
		- need good monitoring or you don't know the true start time of the outage
	- aim for GOLDILOCKS scenario (as close to the true business requirements as possible)
- VLANs, TRUNKS, and QinQ
	- remember LAN is a shared broadcast domain on network layer 2
	- remember each port of a switch is a separate collision domain
	- we want to separate broadcast domains to relevant parties (e.g., sales, security, IoT, whatever)
	- issue is dealing with physical hardware plugged into switches (what if devices are in separate buildings?)
	- Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) solve this issue
	- they add a VLAN ID to 802.1Q ethernet frames
	- creates up to 4096 broadcast domains in the same physical network
		- 802.1AD ethernet frames allow ISPs to use stacked VLANS
		- also called nested QinQ VLANs
		- introduces another field in the frames
		- advanced networking topic, out of scope
	- ACCESS and TRUNK ports on networking switches
	- now, your physical network is managed via switch software
	- you cannot communicate between these networks without layer 3 device (like a router)
	- Public and Privte VIFs in AWS Direct Connect work using VLANs
- DNS
	- funtionally, a big database for looking up IPs by domain name
	- DNS Zone = database containing records (e.g., "\*.netflix.com")
	- ZoneFile = file storing the zone on disk
	- Name Server (NS) server that hosts 1 or more Zones (1 or more ZoneFiles)
	- authoritive servers are the geniune source of truth
	- there are thirteen root DNS server IPs around the world (U of Maryland, NASA, etc.)
		- these thirteen IPs use any-cast so there are realistically many more servers
		- the IP protocol has unicast, broadcast, multicast, anycast, and geocast addressing models
