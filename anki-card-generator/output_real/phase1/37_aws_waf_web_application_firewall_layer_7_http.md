## AWS WAF - Web Application Firewall (Layer 7 HTTP)

- is NOT for DDoS protection
- it is for layer 7 protection (e.g., IP addresses, SQL injection, size constraints, CAPTCHA)
- managed rules for convenience and speed
- Web ACL (WACL) logging can be sent to several sources, with limitations on throughput / delay
- good architecture example
