## Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)

- managed provisioning, backups, patching, and monitoring or various database engines
- run within a VPC, control with Security Groups
- can expand the EBS storage with auto-scaling
- automated PITR, but backups expire
- manual snapshots, set retention time
	- can also move across regions
- management or outage notifications via SNS
- Multi-AZ standby instances for failover
	- application never accesses the standby instance (one DNS name)
- Read Replicas for throughput, eventual consistency, and cross-region
- use Route53 for distributing reads across replicas
	- can leverage health checks
- in-flight and at rest encryption (SSL for in-flight)
- authentication via IAM
	- for MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL
	- what about for other database engines???
	- obtain token via RDS API calls
	- network in/out is therefore always encrypted using SSL
	- EC2 Instance Profiles make this integration easy???
- authorization still is within RDS
- can copy un-encrypted snapshot into encrypted one
- CloudTrail CANNOT track queries made within RDS
- Oracle
	- RDS Backups for backup and restore of Amazon RDS for Oracle
	- Oracle Recover Manager (RMAN) for backup, but restore only NON- Amazon RDS for Oracle
	- Real Application Clusters (RAC) NOT SUPPORTED by RDS
		- must use EC2 for full control
	- use Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for encryption at rest
	- Database Migration Service (DMS) works on Oracle RDS
- RDS for MySQL
	- use "mysqldump" to migrate from RDS to non-RDS instance
- RDS Proxy for AWS Lambda
	- avoid "TooManyConnections" exceptions
	- manages connection pools and cleaning up connections
	- requires either
		- public proxy and public lambda
		- private proxy and lambda in VPC
