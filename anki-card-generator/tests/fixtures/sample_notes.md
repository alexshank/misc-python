## Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on:
- Building systems that learn from data
- Making predictions without explicit programming
- Improving performance over time

### Key Concepts
- **Supervised Learning**: Training with labeled data
  - Classification problems
  - Regression problems
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
  - Clustering
  - Dimensionality reduction

Note: We'll cover neural networks in detail later (not going through basics here).

## Deep Learning Fundamentals

Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers.

### Neural Network Architecture
- Input layer: Receives raw data
- Hidden layers: Extract features and patterns
  - Can have many layers (hence "deep")
  - Each layer transforms data progressively
- Output layer: Produces final predictions

Key components:
- Neurons (nodes) that process information
- Weights that determine connection strength
- Activation functions that introduce non-linearity
